The book **"Meaning In The Brain"** by Giosue Baggio aims to explain how semantic types, semantic tokens and semantic references are created, managed and linked by the human brain. The existence of three semantic systems, the **R-system**, **I-system** and **E-system** is accepted through the book.

The **R-system** which stands for _relational semantics_ is responsible for establishing of semantic relations between words as they occur in sentences or inferred thoughts. During relational processing, lexical semantic types are linked to token representations and are bound together to form larger, more complex relational strcutures. The R-system operates in _short timescales_ while the relational structures computed by the R-system remain generally unavailable to introspection and conscious awareness. The theory of R-system is presented in chapters 1-3.

The **I-system** stands for _interpretative semantics_ and is concerned with constructing a semantic representation aligned to the context of the origin of the thought or the speaker's context. During interpretative processing semantic tokens are mapped to reference representations. Intepretation may also involve elaborative processes the end result of which is a set of inferred thoughts. The I-system operates on _longer timescales_ compared to the R-system while the representation references computed by the I-system are more readily accessible to ingtrospection and conscious awareness and are used to initiate and guide thought and action. The theory of the I-system is presented in chapters 4-6.

The **E-system** stands for _evolutionary semantics_. It is implicated in tracking the degree of coordination between oneself and others especially as far as the associations between words (or communication signals) and meanings are concerned. During coordination reference representations may be linked to new or existing representations of lexical semantic types resulting in the extension or the modification of the lexical semantic set of the individual (learning) or of the community (evolution). The theory of the E-system is presented in the chapters 7-9.

The R-system and I-systems are primarily _processing systems_ which connect semantic types to tokens and tokens to semantic references during the processing phase (discource comprehension). Unlike the R- and I- systems the E-system is a (_cultural_) _learning system_ which explains how the lexical / semantic types are acquired by infants, children and adults and how they might evolve during language use or in the course of transmission from one generation to another.
